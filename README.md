## Game Details

## Technical Conventions

- Branch names: use Jira number and a small description
  - `C4P-1/create-tilemap`
  - `update-readme` (if there is no associated Jira number)
- Commit messages and pull request titles use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
  - Format: `type(scope if there is one): what you did`
    - `feat(main menu): create main menu`
    - `chore(pause menu): fix typo`
    - `refactor(AI): better readability`
- Coding Conventions
  - [Microsoft's C# coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
  - Basically what Visual Studio defaults to if you're using that (since it comes with Unity)
    - Note things like curly braces starting on newlines, otherwise pretty similar to other standards you may be use to
